Learn JavaScript on Coursera:

In this course we will be using the library jQuery to manipulate HTML DOM. While it is possible to do this in plain JavaScript, jQuery makes it much easier. 

The main jQuery site and download is here:

https://jquery.com

jQuery has very extensive documentation, which you can find here:

http://api.jquery.com

Having said that, the API documentation isn't the best place to start learning. The w3schools have a number of tutorials:

as well as the jQuery site itself:

https://learn.jquery.com

Install:
npm install jquery
